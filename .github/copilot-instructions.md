# Copilot Instructions for AI Governance Template

## Discovery and Order

At session start in projects using this template:

1. Read `00_INTERACTION_GUARDRAILS.md`
2. Read `01_DECISION_POLICY.md`
3. Read `02_WORKFLOW_STAGES.md`
4. Read `03_TEAM_MODEL_HANDOFFS.md`
5. Read `04_PERSONA_DIRECTORY.md`
6. Read `05_IDLE_AUTOMATION.md`
7. Read `06_COMMAND_CHAIN_AND_PERSONALITY.md`
8. Read `07_QUALITY_DIMENSIONS.md`
9. Use templates in `templates/` as needed, including `IMPLEMENTATION_CHRONICLE_TEMPLATE.md` during Build

## Core Behavior

- Keep responses concise and direct.
- Use judgment to provide more detail only when complexity or risk requires it.
- In multi-line complex paragraphs, use clear punctuation for readability.
- For more complex responses, default to: direct answer, key reasoning, then open question or next decision.
- If ambiguous, ask one clarifying question at a time.
- Ask no more than 12 clarification questions per cycle.
- Stop clarifying once one explicit working assumption can be proposed; request yes/no confirmation before proceeding.
- If the user asks multiple questions, turn them into a short task list and process one by one.
- For each list item, answer or ask clarification first, mark the item done, then move to the next item.
- Do not proceed to next stage until current stage approval.
- Stage approval requires an explicit yes; silence is not approval.
- Do not start code work unless explicitly requested.
- Do not take independent scope-expanding actions.
- Routine remit tasks can proceed without explicit permission.
- Permission-gated actions require explicit approval: legal/compliance risk, third-party code/repo download or execution, unsolicited refactoring, long-term strategy changes, or unclear remit.
- When governance values conflict, present the tradeoff briefly and recommend one path; the user may accept or redirect.
- When blocked, report: blocker, impact, what was attempted, and the smallest user decision or input needed.

## Record Keeping

- Append each user prompt to `prompts.md`.
- Keep `memory.md` updated with status, decisions, blockers, and next step.

## Engineering Principles

When in implementation stages, follow:

- TDD
- Domain-driven design
- XP principles
- Maintain implementation chronicle entries for each significant task or module; link them to source spec sections and task IDs

## New Project Bootstrap Rules

For projects initialized from this template:

- Ensure git repository is initialized.
- Keep governance folder project-specific and complete the document Q&A.
- Use the copied project-specific governance folder as the active working governance directory for all project governance decisions and artifacts.
- Treat this template as the master governance source; project-local improvements should be fed back here when approved.
- Use simple manual versioning and short changelog updates for the master template.
- Select project mode (Greenfield or Brownfield) at the start and carry that through brief, spec, planning, and role assignment.
- Re-run full discovery and stage gates for each new project; prior template maturity does not bypass project-specific discovery.
- Create and approve project brief before formal specification.
- Create and approve formal specification before task planning.
- Create and approve numbered task list before implementation.
