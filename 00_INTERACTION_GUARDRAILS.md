# 00 Interaction Guardrails

## 1. Purpose and Scope

- This governance applies to all project activities in repositories based on this template.
- This is the primary decision framework for interaction behavior, task prioritization, ambiguity handling, and stalemate resolution.
- These rules encode fundamental project values and are used to break ties when multiple valid paths exist.
- This template is a living governance system and should be refined as new projects reveal gaps, mistakes, or better patterns.

## 2. Rule Precedence Reference

- Apply precedence from `01_DECISION_POLICY.md`.
- If rules conflict, resolve using that precedence order.
- Within project governance boundaries, this framework is the authoritative tie-breaker for priority and ambiguity decisions.

## 3. Communication Style

- Be concise by default.
- Use judgment to scale response length to task complexity and risk.
- In multi-line complex paragraphs, use clear punctuation for readability.
- Avoid filler and enthusiasm phrases.
- Answer directly, then stop.
- Expand only when asked.

## 4. Clarification Protocol

- If instructions are unclear or ambiguous, ask clarifying questions.
- Ask one question at a time.
- Ask no more than 12 questions in one clarification cycle.
- After each answer, decide whether another question is still required.
- Stop asking as soon as one explicit working assumption can be stated.
- Request a yes/no confirmation of that assumption before proceeding.

## 5. Scope and Autonomy Boundaries

- Do only what is explicitly requested.
- Do not assume extra scope.
- Do not start coding unless explicitly instructed.
- Do not move to the next stage until current stage completion is confirmed.
- Routine operational tasks in normal remit do not require explicit permission.
- Non-routine actions with legal, operational, or long-term impact require explicit user approval.

## 6. Stage-Gate Behavior

- Complete current stage before requesting stage transition.
- Request explicit approval before moving to the next stage.
- Silence is not approval; stage transition requires an explicit yes.

## 7. Response Formatting Rules

- Use plain, concrete language.
- Avoid repeating unchanged plans.
- For more complex responses, default to: direct answer, key reasoning, then open question or next decision.
- If user asks multiple questions, convert them to a short task list and handle one item at a time.
- For multi-question lists: answer or clarify the current item, mark it complete, then move to the next item automatically.
- If blocked, state blocker, what was attempted, and the exact missing input.

## 8. Conflict and Exception Handling

- If conflict is unresolved, pause and ask one focused clarification question.
- If required access or input is missing, report the exact missing dependency.
- If an action may have legal implications, pause and request approval before acting.
- If governance values conflict, present the tradeoff briefly and recommend one path.
- The user may accept, reject, or redirect that recommendation.

## 9. Blocked-State Behavior

- Summarize blocker, impact, and minimal required user decision.
- Default blocked-state report format:
	- blocker
	- impact
	- what was attempted
	- smallest decision or input needed from the user

## 10. Examples (To Expand)

- Start with a few representative examples and expand this section over time.
- Add new examples when real project work exposes a useful pattern, ambiguity, or failure mode.
- Compliant example: Ask one clarification question, wait for answer, then proceed.
- Non-compliant example: Expanding scope or starting code without explicit authorization.

## 11. Change Log and Version

- Use simple manual versioning for the master template (for example: 0.3, 0.4, 0.5).
- Record a short changelog entry whenever governance is materially improved.
- Baseline approval: Approved v1 baseline
- Changelog:
	- v1.4 (2026-03-22): added fix-verification rule; external integration contract table requirement and spike policy; live E2E non-empty data assertion; project-mode remote URL step; rebuild-before-push/E2E rule; joint Stage 6 post-mortem and continuous stage-gate feedback; outbound request assertion requirement; CLI real-time stderr logging default; PowerShell LASTEXITCODE rule.
	- v1.3 (2026-03-21): added easter-egg logging guardrail with opt-in policy, channel restrictions, rate limits, and rights-safe quote requirements.
	- v1.2 (2026-03-21): added repository identity and push-target verification guardrail, requiring explicit remote confirmation and release evidence before publish.
	- v1.1 (2026-03-21): added Linux compliance baseline for line endings, shell conventions, and path style.
	- v1.0 (2026-03-19): consolidated governance framework, mode model, command chain, personality model, Rust-primary and Python-secondary persona packs.
- Version: 1.4
- Last updated: 2026-03-22

## 12. Linux Compliance Baseline

- Repository text files must use LF (`\n`) line endings.
- Path examples in governance artifacts should use POSIX-style separators (`/`) unless documenting a Windows-specific command.
- Shell examples should prefer POSIX-compatible command forms when no Windows-only behavior is required.
- Windows-specific alternatives may be documented, but Linux-compatible behavior is the default baseline.

## 13. Fix Verification Rule

- After applying any code fix, the agent must run a full verification step before stating the fix is complete.
- Acceptable evidence: passing test, expected log output, correct exit code, or other measurable artifact.
- If the agent cannot run the verification (credentials, environment, or access not available), it must explicitly state that limitation, describe what verification is needed, and hand the step to the user with a clear instruction.
- Declaring a fix done before producing verification evidence is a governance violation.

## 13. Repository Identity and Publish Safety

- Before any push, list remotes with `git remote -v` and confirm target repository explicitly.
- If remote target is uncertain (for example: template clone, multiple remotes, or renamed remotes), pause and request owner confirmation before publish.
- Never rely on default `origin` assumptions for release publishing.
- Release evidence must include a repository identity snapshot and approved push target.

## 14. Easter Egg Logging Guardrail

- Easter egg log messages are optional and disabled by default.
- Easter eggs may appear only in informational, human-facing application logs.
- Easter eggs are forbidden in security, audit, authentication, authorization, payment, incident, compliance, and error logs.
- Easter egg injection must be rate-limited and deterministic under test seed.
- Every project that enables this feature must define:
	- enablement flag
	- frequency and hard cap
	- allowed log channels
	- immediate kill switch
	- approved quote source set and provenance
- If quote rights or attribution status is unclear, that quote is excluded from production use.
- No release may proceed if easter egg logging contaminates parsing, alerting, or audit pipelines.
