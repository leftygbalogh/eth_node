## 4. XP and DDD Checks

- Pairing or review approach: Completed. TDD driver/navigator pattern used for task-discipline and routing tasks; specialist review pattern applied for brownfield gate and auditability tasks.

  - After T-006: standardized auditability wording between Verify stage and NFR mapping.
- Domain model alignment check: Completed. Stage/task/approval vocabulary aligned with `FORMAL_SPEC.md` section 3 entities and value objects.
- CI quality gates: Completed at governance level.
