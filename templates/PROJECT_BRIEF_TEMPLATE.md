# Project Brief Template

## 1. Project Overview

- Project name:
- Project mode: Greenfield | Brownfield
- Primary implementation language:
- Secondary implementation language(s):
- Language decision status: Fixed | Deferred (must be Fixed before Stage 3 Plan approval)
- Problem statement:
- Desired business/domain outcome:
- In-scope goals:
- Out-of-scope items:

## 1.1 Mode-Specific Direction

- Greenfield: domain discovery and architecture evolution priorities
- Brownfield: implemented behavior baseline and parity priorities

## 1.2 Quality Module Declarations

Declare active Q3 modules at project start. Once declared, these become core expectations for the duration of this project.

- Data Quality module active? Yes | No
  - Trigger: project uses persistent storage, schemas, or migrations
- Compliance & Auditability module active? Yes | No
  - Trigger: project has regulatory scope (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2, financial, healthcare, etc.)
  - If yes, specify applicable regulations:

Note: Q1 core pack (Problem Understanding, Architecture, Code Quality, Testing, Security, Process & Workflow) is always active. Q2 stage-unlocked dimensions activate automatically at their named stages. See `07_QUALITY_DIMENSIONS.md`.

## 8. Risks and Unknowns

- Risk 1:
- Risk 2:
- Unknown 1:
- Unknown 2:

## 8.1 Brownfield Legacy Uncertainty Handling (Required if mode is Brownfield)

- Discovery timebox (days or sprint fraction):
- Legacy surface map in scope (modules/endpoints/jobs):
- Evidence sources used (code, runtime traces, logs, existing tests, SMEs):
- Hidden prerequisites and setup checklist captured? Yes | No
- Characterization test baseline planned? Yes | No
  - High-risk paths to lock first:
- Confidence rating by area: High | Medium | Low
- Delivery gate for feature commitments:
  - Go only if minimum confidence threshold is met and parity-risk controls are defined
  - If threshold is not met, choose one: extend discovery | reduce scope | run stabilization sprint
- Ambiguity escalation path:
  - Cross-role clarification attempted first? Yes | No
  - If unresolved, final decision owner:

## 9. Stage Approval
