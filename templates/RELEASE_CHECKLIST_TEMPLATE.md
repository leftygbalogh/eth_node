# Release Checklist

**Note:** This checklist must be filled in for each project based on the project brief and formal specification. Do not leave example or template defaults.

## Stage 5 Verify Results

- [x] Syntax check passes for all deliverable scripts or binaries as defined in the project brief.
- [x] Startup, event handling, and all main behaviors are verified as specified in the formal spec.
- [x] All runtime error and edge-case handling paths are implemented and verified per requirements.
- [x] Scoring, output, and artifact requirements are implemented as specified.
- [x] No extra features/configuration added beyond the approved spec.
- [ ] For projects with a compiled or packaged build step: release artifact rebuilt from HEAD immediately before this verification run; artifact timestamp verified to post-date the last commit.
- [ ] For projects integrating with external data sources: live E2E produced at least one non-empty real data record from at least one live integration point; zero-record results are recorded as failures unless explicitly expected for the test scenario.

## Stage 6 Release

- [x] All deliverables listed in the project brief are present.
- [x] All logging, output, and artifact requirements are implemented as specified.
- [x] Governance artifacts updated for stages 1-6
- [x] Agent feedback file updated- [ ] Repo root layout audit: no stray generated files (PDFs, test artifacts, data dumps) in repo root; `output/` and `build/` directories are confirmed gitignored; governance, source code, and runtime output are in clearly separated folders.- [ ] For projects with a compiled or packaged build step: release artifact rebuilt from HEAD immediately before this release commit and push; artifact timestamp verified to post-date the last commit.
- [ ] Push target verified immediately before publish: `git remote -v` captured in evidence
- [ ] Intended remote and branch explicitly stated and approved before push
- [ ] Release remote proof snapshot saved: `docs/evidence/release-remote-proof.md`
- [ ] Joint post-mortem complete: agent improvement entries written to `examples/feedback.json` for all stages; product owner consulted and response recorded (additions or explicit pass); feedback file committed.
