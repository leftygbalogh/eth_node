# Numbered Task List Template

## Reference Standards

- Definition of Ready (DoR): see `02_WORKFLOW_STAGES.md` — a task may not start until all DoR items are met.
- Definition of Done (DoD): see `02_WORKFLOW_STAGES.md` — a task is done only when all DoD items are met.
- Implementation chronicle template: `templates/IMPLEMENTATION_CHRONICLE_TEMPLATE.md`

## 1. Planning Metadata

- Plan ID:
- Source formal spec:
- Version:
- Project mode: Greenfield | Brownfield
- Implementation language(s):
- Owner:
- Date:

## 2. Work Order Rules

- Tasks are strictly numbered.
- Each task references source spec requirement IDs.
- Each task must meet the DoR before work starts.
- Each task must meet the universal DoD before it is marked Done.
- Dependencies must be explicit.
- Progress is recorded against each task.
- Blocked status requires explicit blocker reason.
- Done status requires traceability links (spec -> task -> tests -> chronicle).
- Brownfield plans should prefer tiny, behavior-safe increments.
- Brownfield tasks should include parity checks at the smallest practical unit.
